This is the README file for the RobRails.com application which I will work on for next couple of months.

The application is reployed onto GitHub.com under https://github.com/robrails87/robrails.git

This application can be cloned from the GitHub.com
Simply use the following command. $ git clone https://github.com/robrails87/robrails.git

1. The application will be avaible on robrails.com which doimain is purchased from GoDaddy.com for one year. It will expire on 03/23/2014.
2. I am planning to use linode as the server to host the website.
